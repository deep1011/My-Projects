## Linear Regression
Linear regression shows the linear relationship between the independent variable (X-axis) and the dependent variable (Y-axis), consequently called linear regression. If there is a single input variable (x), such linear regression is called simple linear regression.
In this, I will take random numbers for the dependent variable (salary) and an independent variable (experience) and will predict the impact of a year of experience on salary.
Library used Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn
