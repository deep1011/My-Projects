## Sales data analysis

 Sales analysis is the process of integrating, analyzing, and understanding various data related to sales activities such as sales, customers, and transaction data.
Used various libraies like numpy, pandas, MatplotLib for visualisation
And find some useful insights from data.


## Cricket Analysis 
Solve multiple very interesting data-driven case studies like:
"A faceoff between AB De Villers and Bumrah : Who dominates whom?"
"Kohli vs Sachin : An analytical debate"
Used various libraies like numpy, pandas, MatplotLib for visualisation
And find some useful insights from data.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression shows the linear relationship between the independent variable (X-axis) and the dependent variable (Y-axis), consequently called linear regression. If there is a single input variable (x), such linear regression is called simple linear regression.
In this, I will take random numbers for the dependent variable (salary) and an independent variable (experience) and will predict the impact of a year of experience on salary.
Library used Numpy, Pandas, scikit-learn

## Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression is basically indicating that we will be having many features Such as f1, f2, f3, f4, and our output feature f5. If we take the same example as above we discussed, suppose:
f1 is the size of the house.

f2 is bad rooms in the house.

f3 is the locality of the house.

f4 is the condition of the house and,

f5 is our output feature which is the price of the house.

Now, you can see that multiple independent features also make a huge impact on the price of the house, price can vary from feature to feature. When we are discussing multiple linear regression then the equation of simple linear regression y=A+Bx is converted to something like:

                            equation:  y = A+B1x1+B2x2+B3x3+B4x4
 applied multiple linear regression on the 50_startups dataset, you can click here to download the dataset.
